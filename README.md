Bookshelf Web Application

This book app takes a array of book data objects and turns it into a list of the books that you 
can add to, sort by language, add favorites and add comments no longer then 280 characters.
Comes with two extra pages that could be customized for a possible book app background info
or a cart for checking out/ordering books.

In this project i needed to complete the TDD 5 alternate assesment along with the rest of the project.
Using filter to be able to sort the languages of the books into 4 different languages.
Another tool that i used was sessionStorage to store comments and be able to acces them while 
the screen is open even with a refresh. Learning that was very interesting.

In the actual bookshelf I gave some of the elements a border and background to get the look of a actual bookshelf.
In this code I also used a couple event listeners for the buttons along with hiding some elements.
